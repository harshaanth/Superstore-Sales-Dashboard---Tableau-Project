## Purpose
The aim of this project was to develop a responsive Tableau dashboard to analyze sales and profit data for a fictional Superstore. The project demonstrates my **data sense-making**, **visual storytelling**, and the ability to design visually compelling, insightful dashboards that drive business decisions.

## Dashboard Features
### 1. **Superstore Sales Dashboard**:
   - **Sales by Segment**: A pie chart that breaks down sales by Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office segments.
   - **Sales by Market and Country**: A bar chart that highlights sales across various countries and segments. The chart can be filtered using the segments.
   - **Sales by Profit**: A scatter plot that compares sales and profit for various products, segmented by Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office.

### 2. **Interactive Actions**:
   - **Filter Action**: The "Sales by Segment" pie chart allows users to filter the entire dashboard by segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).
   - **Highlight Action**: Hovering over the "Sales by Market and Country" chart highlights the corresponding country and segment data.
   - **Tooltip Enhancement**: Detailed country-level sales data is shown when hovering over the "Sales by Market" bars.

### 3. **Instructions and Formatting**:
   - **Dashboard Title**: Centered and responsive for all devices.
   - **Instructions**: Users are guided on how to interact with the dashboard using click and hover actions.
   - **Dynamic Titles**: Titles automatically update based on the filter applied.

## Insights
1. **Consumer Segment Dominance**: The dashboard highlights that the **Consumer segment** accounts for more than half of total sales, followed by the Corporate segment.
2. **United States as the Top Market**: The U.S. leads in sales, far outpacing other countries such as Australia and France.
3. **Profit-Sales Correlation**: While there is a positive correlation between sales and profit, a few data points indicate that some products generate significant sales but are unprofitable. This is critical for business decision-making in terms of product focus and market strategy.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to create interactive, insightful dashboards that allow users to explore data and uncover trends. It showcases my Tableau proficiency in handling business data, delivering visually appealing reports, and using data storytelling to drive actionable business decisions.
